# quarkus-annotations

quarkus-annotations is a kotlin lib for projects using quarkus with reactive functionality.
It permits to abstract the process of writing sql queries by generating them with annotations and provide methods to
prevent writing redundant queries.

quarkus-annotations only works with postgres db and was made to learn code generation and annotations.
We highly recommend to use jdbc since it's far more complete and stable than this lib.
