# quarkus-annotations

quarkus-annotations is a kotlin orm for projects using quarkus resteasy reactive.
It permits to abstract the process of writing sql queries by generating them with annotations and provide methods to
prevent writing redundant queries.

quarkus-annotations only works with postgres db and was made to learn code generation and annotations.
Though it's easier and less pain to use than hibernate, we highly recommend to use hibernate since it's far more 
complete and stable than this undocumented and barely maintainable lib.
